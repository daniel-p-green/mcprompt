# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Product Overview

MC Prompt is a Swift-based, hammer-inspired application that manages, customizes, and shares Large Language Model prompts across Apple devices using iCloud synchronization. Users insert variables into templates for dynamic reuse, while enterprises leverage a per-seat SaaS model. The brand’s hammer icon symbolizes construction, utility, and power.

**Key Differentiators**  
- **Seamless iCloud Sync** (Confidence: 90%) – Apple’s CloudKit frameworks offer robust syncing, though we must handle conflict resolution carefully.  
- **Creator Marketplace** (Confidence: 85%) – We will allow creators to publish and sell prompt “packs.” Most Apple in-app purchase flows are well-documented, but marketplace success hinges on curated content and discoverability.  
- **B2B Collaboration** (Confidence: 95%) – Enterprises can manage seat-based licensing, share private libraries, and integrate with existing Single Sign-On solutions.

2. **Access Prompts Anywhere**  
   - Users want to seamlessly retrieve and synchronize their prompt libraries across macOS and iOS devices without manually copying or pasting.  
3. **Share & Collaborate**  
   - Organizations want to distribute prompt libraries to maintain consistency in messaging and reduce training overhead.  
4. **Earn Revenue from Prompt Packs**  
   - Prompt creators want to publish specialized libraries (e.g., HR templates, marketing campaigns, legal disclaimers) and earn income through in-app purchases.  

---

## 3. User Personas

1. **Individual Power User (Freelancer/Creator)**  
   - **Goals:** Boost productivity, quickly adapt prompts, monetize specialized prompt packs.  
   - **Frustrations:** Manual copying from notes, outdated prompt expansions, inconsistent versions across devices.

2. **Team Lead (SMB Owner/Department Head)**  
   - **Goals:** Ensure consistent communication, share best-practice prompts with team, track usage.  
   - **Frustrations:** Lack of standardized libraries, version control issues, repeated corrections of team output.  
   - **Usage Pattern:** Weekly curation and distribution of new prompts, feedback on usage from team.

3. **Enterprise Administrator (Large Company/IT Department)**  
   - **Goals:** Control access via seat-based licensing, enforce content governance, ensure high security and compliance.  
   - **Frustrations:** Siloed prompt repositories, complex user management across teams, concerns about data leaks.  
   - **Usage Pattern:** Manages user provisioning, monitors analytics, integrates with corporate identity management systems.

## 4. User Flows & Edge Cases

### 4.1 Individual User Flow

1. **Onboarding**  
   - User installs MC Prompt from the App Store and grants iCloud permissions.  
   - User sees a brief product tour highlighting key features (variable insertion, library management).  
2. **Prompt Creation**  
   - User taps “New Prompt.”  
   - User types a prompt and inserts placeholders (e.g., `{{recipientName}}`).  
   - User saves prompt to a personal library.  
3. **Prompt Use**  
   - User selects a saved prompt and enters the dynamic placeholder values.  
   - User copies or shares the generated text (email, social, or direct to an AI tool).  
4. **Marketplace Browsing**  
   - User visits the “Marketplace” tab to discover curated prompt packs.  
   - User purchases a specialized prompt pack using Apple In-App Purchase.  
5. **Edge Cases**  
   - **No iCloud Access:** Prompt library falls back to local storage. The system displays an alert encouraging iCloud sign-in.  
   - **Network Lag:** Delayed sync might cause version conflicts. The system prompts the user to pick the most recent version.

### 4.2 Team Collaboration Flow

1. **Team Setup**  
   - Team Lead creates an MC Prompt Organization account.  
   - Team Lead invites members via email or an SSO link.  
2. **Prompt Library Sharing**  
   - Team Lead uploads or creates prompt sets with placeholders relevant to team usage.  
   - Team members see shared libraries in their MC Prompt app under a “Team” section.  
3. **Collaboration**  
   - Team members edit or comment on shared prompts (if they have sufficient permissions).  
   - The system logs changes and syncs them to iCloud.  
4. **Edge Cases**  
   - **Permission Conflicts:** Two users attempt to edit a prompt simultaneously. The system merges changes or flags a conflict for resolution.  
   - **User Offboarding:** Admin revokes access. The system immediately restricts library usage for that seat.

### 4.3 Enterprise Deployment Flow

1. **Enterprise Admin Onboarding**  
   - Admin integrates MC Prompt with corporate SSO (e.g., Okta, Azure AD).  
   - Admin defines seat licenses for each department.  
2. **Policies & Governance**  
   - Admin configures data retention policies, permissible sharing rules, and compliance checks.  
3. **Analytics & Monitoring**  
   - Admin reviews usage metrics: frequency of prompt use, most popular prompts, or user adoption rates.  
4. **Edge Cases**  
   - **Regulatory Requirements:** Some industries require on-prem or region-specific data storage. The system can optionally disable iCloud and store prompts on an on-prem cloud or private server.  
   - **Security Breach Attempts:** Admin sees suspicious activity and revokes seat licenses or adjusts user permissions.

## 5. Business Model

1. **Freemium Core**  
   - Free download and usage for individual users with unlimited device sync.  
   - Users can create prompts, sync them via iCloud, and share with up to 2 collaborators for free (sufficient for small teams or personal usage).

2. **Marketplace Revenue**  
   - Prompt creators sell specialized “prompt packs” via in-app purchases.  
   - We retain a percentage of each sale (e.g., 70/30 split in favor of the creator).  
   - Apple’s guidelines govern standard transaction fees and compliance with in-app purchase policies.

3. **B2B SaaS Pricing**  
   - Per-seat monthly or annual subscription for teams and enterprises.  
   - Includes advanced features: unlimited collaboration, enterprise analytics, advanced user management, and robust SSO integration.  
   - Custom pricing tiers for large deployments that require compliance or specialized support.

4. **Potential Upsell Opportunities**  
   - In-app purchase “Pro” add-on for advanced editing or automation features (e.g., dynamic placeholders with conditionals).  
   - Optional brand customization for corporate identity alignment.

## 6. Technical Feasibility & Architecture

1. **Frontend**  
   - **Tech Stack:** Swift + SwiftUI for iOS, iPadOS, and macOS.  
   - **Reasoning:** Apple frameworks optimize performance and unify code for multiple Apple platforms. (Confidence: 95%)

2. **Data Layer**  
   - **Primary Storage:** CloudKit for iCloud-based data sync.  
   - **Local Caching:** Core Data or SwiftData for offline support and real-time editing.  
   - **Conflict Resolution:** Leverage CloudKit record versioning to handle simultaneous edits. (Confidence: 90% – requires thorough testing)

3. **Marketplace Infrastructure**  
   - **App Store In-App Purchases** for iOS and macOS.  
   - **Server-Side**: Swift back-end or Serverless endpoints (e.g., AWS Lambda) for user authentication and marketplace asset hosting.  
   - **Payment Flows:** Apple’s in-app purchase system handles transactions, while a lightweight back-end tracks purchased prompt packs. (Confidence: 85% – success depends on user adoption and curated marketplace approach)

4. **Security & Compliance**  
   - Data remains encrypted at rest using Apple’s recommended frameworks.  
   - End-to-end encryption for prompt library content if enterprise customers require stricter compliance.  
   - Single Sign-On integration for B2B solutions with token-based authentication.
